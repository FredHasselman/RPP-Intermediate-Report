3	A needs-based model of reconciliation: Satisfying the differential emotional needs of victim and perpetrator as a key to promoting reconciliation.	F(1, 90) = 6.98	94	η^2	0.07	0.0097	0.268278964521451	F(1, 142) = 1.26	0.9	146	η^2	0.01	0.26	0.0937827145210083	same	https://osf.io/xse7q/	incomplete report of original study, check results original study in pdf; It was not clear to me what effect will be replicated, and actually when I look at the analysis plan it seems that a lot of different things will be replicated but it was not clear to me what exactly. Also the results in the original paper (study 4)included many seperate analyses.	NA		
4	The value of believing in free will: Encouraging a belief in determinism increases cheating.	t(28) = 3.04	30	d	0.88	0.0051	0.498149177998044	t(56)= -.77	0.91	58	d	0.2	0.44	0.102355162144048	same	https://osf.io/i29mh/	Not eligible because replication not ran as intended; again there were several different analyses, of which I thought that the cheating effect was most important, so I wrote down the test statistics of this analysis ('cheating' subsection of results of experiment 1 on p.50) They also did a mediation anlysis. so Im not sure whether I picked the right one.

Strange thing about the other statistic mentioned in the replication is that it seems to focus on experiment 2 and; t(39)=2.82, p = .008, d=0.44, in the timing task (p 26) is mentioned in the replication in the confirmatory analysis part of the results, but in the power analysis part of the replication they mention t(39)=3.77,p<0.001,d=0.60, which is again the results of the time task in the original study but this time is part of experiment 1 instead of 2. So which one do they replicate? I think that most important is the interaction: F(1.63, 63.90) = 64.87, p < .001. (which is fortunately equal in the poweranalysis part and the results part of the replication paper)	NA

This means there are actually also 2 effect sizes, of which only one is given in this excelsheet. The effect sizes for the two findings were partial eta-squared=.09 and .016 for resp exp 1 and 2.	NA		
13	Opening the mind to close it: Considering a message in light of important values increases message processing and later resistance to change.

On p59. And 't(11) = 5.98, p < .0001' and 't(11) = 2.7, p < .05' which are both on p 60. So I don’t know what is replicated since I could also not find that in the replication paper.	NA

The test statistics I wrote down are of the nearness effect. But actually they also hypothesized the distance effect of which the test statistics are: F(1, 21) = 5.2, p= .05, however the nearness effect seemed more important also as described in the replication paper.
